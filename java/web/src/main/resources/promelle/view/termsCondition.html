				<p class="text-bold text-uppercase">Bookings, Service Fees and Financial Terms</p>
				<p class="text-muted">PromElle charges a service fee to the Dress Lender (the “Service Fee”), which is based on a percentage of the rental listing price that a Renter pays to an Lender (the “Rental Price”). The Service Fee paid to PromElle is equal to twenty five percent (25%) of the Rental Price and the Lender keeps seventy five percent (75%) of the Rental Price. PromElle will collect the Service Fees from Renter at the time payment is disbursed which is immediately upon Renter completing the rental transaction. Each Lender hereby permits PromElle to collect payments made by the Renter. Each Lender agrees that payment of a Rental Price made by a Renter to PromElle shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to the Lender and the Lender will make the item for rent available to Renter in the agreed upon manner as if the Lender has received the Rental Price. Each Lender agrees that PromElle may in accordance with the cancellation policy, (i) permit the Renter to cancel the booking 24 hours after the rental period starts for reasons when the item does not fit and (ii) refund to the Renter that portion of the Rental Price specified in the cancellation policy. PromElle assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of the Lender. Lenders are solely responsible for honoring any confirmed bookings and making available any item for rent reserved through the application. Once a Renter, chooses to enter into a transaction with an Lender for the rental of a dress, Renter acknowledges and agrees to accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with the specific dress for rent imposed by the Lender. You acknowledge and agree that you, and not PromElle, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such agreements, that PromElle is not a party to such agreements, and that, with the exception of its payment obligations hereunder, PromElle disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements. You acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding the fact that PromElle is not a party to the agreement between you and the Lender, PromElle accepts payments from you on behalf of the Lender. Upon a Renter’s payment of the Rental Price to PromElle, Renter’s payment obligation to the Lender (not taking into account any damage charges) for such amounts is fulfilled. PromElle is responsible for remitting such amounts, less applicable Service Fees, to the Lender. In the event that PromElle does not remit any such amounts to a Lender, such Lender will have recourse only against PromElle.</p>
				<p class="text-muted">Renters are responsible for reading Dress Listings, including, without limitation, the description of the item and any policies or instructions. If a Renter requests to rent an item, the Renter agrees to pay PromElle the Rental Price for such item. In order to establish a rental, you understand and agree that PromElle, on behalf of the Lender, reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to obtain payment via your credit card for the amount of the Rental Price. PromElle will collect the Rental Price in accordance with the pricing terms set forth in the applicable Dress Listing. Please note that PromElle cannot control any fees that may be charged to a Member by his or her own bank related to PromElle’s collection of the Rental Price, and PromElle disclaims all liability in this respect.</p>
